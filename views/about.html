<h1>General questions:</h1><h3>Who are you?</h3><p>We are a collection of open data advocates from Hong Kong. We believe that open, accessible data is vital to improving the overall health and well-being of Hong Kong. In that spirit, we built Hong Kong Census Explorer to provide a platform for easily creating, sharing, and exploring the Hong Kong government.</p><h3>Why did you build this?</h3><p>With this open-source project, we hope to make a previously cumbersome task -- exploring the data generated by the Hong Kong government’s census -- easily accessible by journalists, advocates, developers, and interested citizens.</p><p>By providing a JSON-based API to the data, we hope to encourage active development, exploration and investigation. Our open-source platform allows anyone to develop mashups and visualizations and contribute them back to our community.</p><h3>How do I use this?</h3><p>There are two ways to interact with this data.</p><p>As an end-user, you can browse the data and view the various mashups and visualizations built with the data here.</p><p>As a developer, you can build and contribute your own visualizations. When complete, you can email us details or simply submit them as a pull-request on Github. More details about this are below. You can also help us improve our core code as well. There’s always something that needs work.</p><h3>Can I help contribute?</h3><p>Absolutely. Fork the code on Github and send a pull request. Or build your own visualization and tell us about it. Or just email us to see how you can help!</p><h1>Technical questions</h1><h3>What’s powering Hong Kong Census Explorer?</h3><p>Our backend API was built with Python/Flask, and is running on Google App Engine. The data from the Hong Kong Government was retrieved and normalized using a myriad of Python scripts.</p><p>Our frontend is built using AngularJS. Visualizations are largely built using the d3.js javascript framework (or any other appropriate Javascript framework -- refer to the source for each visualization for more details.)</p><h3>How to get/use the data?</h3><p>Please visit the <a href="#/getdata">Get Data</a> page</p>
